      Shortest Path algorithm

In this project, you'll learn how to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.

# Tower of Hanoi, recursion

Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.

In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.

In this project, you will solve the mathematical puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.

The goal of this puzzle is moving the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following specific rules that restrict placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

# Vector Space
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an common data structure where data is sorted hierarchically.

In this project, you'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. You'll also learn key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

# Equation solver
Abstract classes enable you to define formal interfaces - objects acting as blueprints for classes.

In this project, you'll discover how to implement an interface in Python while building a simple equation solver program.
 x = (−b ± (√b**2-4ac)) / 2a 

 # Trajectory calculator
 Encapsulation is a core OOP principle based on writing code that limits direct access to data.

In this project, you'll discover new concepts related to encapsulation, such as getters, setters, and name mangling, and you'll use them together with what you already learned to create a program that calculates a projectile trajectory.

d = v⋅cosθ⋅(v⋅sinθ + √v**2sin**2θ+2⋅g⋅h) / g 
    In which d is the displacement, v is the starting speed, 
    θ is the angle and  h is the starting height

y = y[0] + xtanθ − gx**2/2x**cos**2 0
