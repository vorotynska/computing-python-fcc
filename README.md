      Shortest Path algorithm

In this project, you'll learn how to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.

# Tower of Hanoi, recursion

Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.

In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.

In this project, you will solve the mathematical puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.

The goal of this puzzle is moving the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following specific rules that restrict placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
